force and laws of motion
In this chapter, we're looking at why things move and what makes them move. It's been a big question for a long time. Imagine a ball sitting still. If you give it a little push, it doesn't keep moving forever. This made people think that staying still is the natural way for things to be. But then, along came Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. They had a different idea.

In our everyday lives, we notice that we need to do something to make things start moving or to stop them from moving. Usually, we use our muscles to push, hit, or pull on things. We call this effort a force. But what exactly is a force? Well, we can't see, taste, or touch it directly. But we can see what happens when we use force. When we push, hit, or pull something, it starts moving because we've applied a force to it.

You might have learned in school that a force can do a few things to an object. It can make it speed up or slow down, change its direction, or even change its shape and size. So, forces are pretty important when it comes to understanding why things move and what makes them move in different ways.


balanced and unbalanced forces
This tells us about the forces and how they affect how things move. It explains the difference between balanced and unbalanced forces. Balanced forces happen when two equal forces push or pull in opposite directions, keeping things still or moving at the same speed. Unbalanced forces occur when one force is stronger than the other, making things move in the direction of the stronger force. Friction, which is a force that opposes motion, plays a big role in stopping things from moving unless a stronger force is applied. It's explained that to keep something moving, you need to keep applying a force to it. But once you stop applying that force, the thing will keep moving at the same speed it was going.


first law of motion
Galileo observed that objects on an inclined plane move with constant speed when no force acts on them. As a marble rolls down the incline, its velocity increases, driven by the unbalanced force of gravity. When the marble climbs up, its velocity decreases. Galileo proposed that on a frictionless double-inclined plane, a marble released from one side would reach the same height on the opposite side. Newton expanded on Galileo's ideas and formulated three laws of motion. The first law, known as the law of inertia, states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. This law explains why we tend to stay still in a moving car until brakes are applied, and why we lean backwards when a bus suddenly starts moving. It also clarifies why we are thrown to one side when a car makes a sharp turn. Inertia, the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion, governs these experiences.
inertia of mass
Whether an object is at rest or in motion, it tends to maintain its current state unless an external force is applied. This property of objects is termed inertia. However, not all objects possess the same level of inertia. Heavier or more massive objects exhibit greater resistance to changes in motion compared to lighter ones. This variation in inertia is evident in everyday experiences, such as the ease of pushing an empty box versus one filled with books, or the difference in the impact when kicking a football versus a stone of equal size. The concept of inertia is quantitatively measured by an object's mass, reflecting its tendency to resist changes in motion. Therefore, inertia serves as a fundamental principle in understanding how objects behave in response to external forces and their resistance to changes in motion.
second law of motion
The first law of motion asserts that when an unbalanced external force acts on an object, its velocity changes, resulting in acceleration. This acceleration depends on the force applied to the object and can be measured. Everyday observations, such as the impact of objects varying with their mass and velocity, suggest the importance of a quantity combining mass and velocity, known as momentum. Momentum, defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity, has both magnitude and direction. The application of an unbalanced force changes an object's momentum, indicating that force also affects momentum change. In practical scenarios, like pushing a car with a dead battery, it's observed that the magnitude of force and the duration of its application influence the change in momentum. This leads to the conclusion that the force required to change an object's momentum depends on the rate at which the momentum changes. The second law of motion quantifies this relationship, stating that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force.
MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF
SECOND LAW OF MOTION
The excerpt delves into the fundamental principles of Newtonian mechanics, particularly focusing on Newton's second law of motion. It begins by establishing the concept of momentum, defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity. From there, it derives the formula for force, which is \( F = ma \), where \( F \) represents force, \( m \) is mass, and \( a \) denotes acceleration. The text emphasizes that the rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force. To standardize this relationship, a constant of proportionality is determined, leading to the definition of the unit of force, the newton. Real-world scenarios, such as catching a cricket ball or executing a high jump in athletics, are employed to illustrate the practical implications of Newton's second law. These examples demonstrate how the understanding of force, mass, and acceleration governs various physical phenomena. Finally, the excerpt briefly touches upon Newton's first law, which asserts that an object will remain at rest or continue moving at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force, thus providing a foundational understanding of inertia.
third law of motion
The passage elucidates Newton's third law of motion, which delineates the concept of action and reaction forces. It asserts that whenever one object exerts a force on another, the second object instantaneously exerts an equal force in the opposite direction. This law is exemplified through scenarios like collisions in sports, where players experience equal and opposite forces upon impact. Additionally, experiments with spring balances corroborate this law, showing that forces exerted by interconnected objects are equal but opposite. The practical implications of this law are demonstrated in various contexts, such as firearm recoil and propulsion systems. Moreover, it emphasizes that while these action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, the resulting accelerations may differ due to variations in mass. Overall, Newton's third law serves as a fundamental principle in understanding force interactions, underlining the symmetry and balance inherent in physical phenomena.
